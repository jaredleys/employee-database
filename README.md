# employee-database
Schema and analysis of a fictional employee database.

This project includes a schema and several sample queries for a fictional employee database. Each table has its primary key, several refer to a foreign key, and some contain composite keys where they are made up of only foreign keys from separate table. The ERD helps provide visual explanation of these details.

The sample queries attempt to show off ways that data could be combined and analyzed across the table.
